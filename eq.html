      This script demonstrates audio effects resulting from <b>Audio Filters</b>. It is
      designed for a first insight into the perceptual effect of filtering an audio signal.
      Besides the different filter functions and their acoustical effect the script offers
      a first insight into the logarithmic behavior of loudness and frequency resolution of
      our human acoustical perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following filter types can be set in the lower part of the user interface; their
      parameters can be controlled by dragging the red dot(s) in the frequency response graph.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Low-/High-pass filter</b> (LP/HP) with control parameter
        <ul>
          <li>cut-off frequency</li>
          <li>all frequencies above (LP) or below (HP) the cut-off frequency are attenuated
            according to the shown frequency response
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Low/High-frequency shelving filter</b> (LFS/HFS) with control parameters
        <ul>
          <li>cut-off frequency fc</li>
          <li>boost/cut</li>
          <li>all frequencies below (LFS) or above (HFS) the cut-off frequency are
            boosted/cut according to the selected boost/cut
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Peak filter</b> with control parameters
        <ul>
          <li>center frequency fc</li>
          <li>boost/cut</li>
          <li> Q-factor Q=fb/fc, which controls the bandwidth fb of the boost/cut around
            the adjusted center frequency fc. Lower Q-factor means wider bandwidth.
          </li>
          <li>the peak filter boosts/cuts the center frequency with a bandwidth adjusted
            by the Q-factor.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The center window shows the frequency response (filter gain versus frequency) of
      the selected filter functions. You can choose between a linear and a logarithmic
      frequency axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose between two predefined audio signals or your own local audio file to
      be processed.
