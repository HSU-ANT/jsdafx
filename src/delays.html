  This script demonstrates audio effects resulting from delay-based algorithms.
  It is designed for a first insight into the perceptual experience of one
  amplitude-modulation and three delay-based audio effects: tremolo, vibrato,
  chorus, and flanger.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Tremolo</b> is the rapid repetition of one note in music terminology or a
  rapid alternation between two or more notes (string instruments, mandolin,
  flute, piano, harpsichord, spinet, guitar). In technical terminology tremolo
  is a rapid repetitive increase and decrease in volume. The effect is based on
  modifying the time domain envelope (amplitude) of a signal.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Vibrato</b> is the rapid and repetitive variation in pitch for the duration
  of a note (string instruments, guitar, singing voice, yodeling). In technical
  terminology the effect is based on modifying the pitch of a signal by delay
  line modulation (phase modulation).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Chorus</b> simulates the result of an ensemble of musicians (singers,
  violins) playing together with slight pitch and amplitude differences. The
  chorus effect performs a loudness increase. These amplitude and pitch
  differences are simulated by amplitude modulation and delay line modulation
  (phase modulation) and all signals are summed together to form the output
  signal.
</p>

<p>
  A <b>flanger</b> simulates a special filter effect wich occurs if a slowly
  time-varying single reflection is added to the direct signal (jet airplane
  effect). This effect was achieved by playing two copies of a single signal
  from two tape machines while slowing down the replay speed of one tape machine
  by placing a finger to the flange of one tape reel.
</p>

<p>
  You can choose between two predefined audio signals or your own local audio
  file to be processed.
