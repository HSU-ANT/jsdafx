  This script demonstrates audio effects resulting from a Fast Convolution algorithm. It is
  designed for a first insight into the perceptual effects of convolving an inpulse
  response with an audio signal.
</p>
<p>
  The script generates an impulse response by modulating the amplitude of a random signal.
  The graphical interface presents the curve of the amplitude modulation, which can be
  manipulated with three control points. Two control points are used for the initial
  behaviour of the amplitude modulation. The third control point is used for the
  exponential decay of the impulse response.
</p>
<p>
  You can choose between two predefined audio signals or your own local audio file to
  be processed.
