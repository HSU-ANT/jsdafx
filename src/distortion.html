      This script demonstrates audio effects resulting from nonlinear signal distortion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input signal is routed over the nonlinear transfer function plotted above.
      The marked handle allows you to adjust the input and output gain of the audio signal.
      Horizontal movement changes the input gain, vertical movement changes the output
      gain. Please be careful: the signal may be clipped at the top and bottom, which
      will produce awful sounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose between two predefined audio signals or your own local audio file to
      be processed.
